Package `pgproto` is a pure Go client and server protocol library for [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/**.
It provides the necessary structures and functions to parse and encode client or server PostgreSQL messages.

The scope of `pgproto` is only for parsing/encoding messages and does not handle connections between PostgreSQL client and server.

Installation:

```bash
go get github.com/c653labs/pgproto
